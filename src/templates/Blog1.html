        <h1>Launching BuzzardBuilds: My Brainstorming Adventure in Side Hustles and Dev Dreams</h1>
        <p>By Nelson Kays | February 21, 2026</p>
        <p>Welcome to the nest, fellow builders! This post recaps a fun, feisty brainstorming session with my AI sidekick, Grok. We're plotting my escape from the 9-to-5 engineering grind into a world of side incomes that let my creative buzzard soar. From web dev sprints to SolidWorks sass, let's dive in—scavenger style!</p>
    </header>

    <section id="brand-story">
        <h2>The BuzzardBuilds Origin Story: From Balsa to Brand</h2>
        <p>Everything kicked off with my undergrad senior design project—a UAV we cheekily named the "Balsa Buzzard." That scrappy, soaring spirit inspired my brand: BuzzardBuilds. It's broad enough to cover aero adventures, CNC tinkering, drone dreams. I dig the scavenger-hunter vibe: spotting opportunities in scraps and turning them into triumphs.</p>
        <p>We're good on the name for now—I've snagged buzzardbuilds.com, buzzardbuilds@gmail.com, and the Instagram handle. Open to tweaks as we evolve, but alternatives like "Wingspan Works" or "AeroForge" felt too aviation-locked. What sticks? The gritty, fun mascot potential—imagine a buzzard icon that's part engineer, part explorer. It's sweat equity for now, but building that brand could be a blast.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="goals">
        <h2>The Big Picture: Engineering My Way Out of Engineering</h2>
        <p>My ultimate goal? Develop side incomes that let me break free from full-time engineering gigs. I'm currently an electronic systems engineer (resume a bit outdated, but the skills hold), with a background in mechanical engineering and packaging design from stints at Boeing and EPE USA. Thinking on how to monetize that outside the cubicle?</p>
        <p>Bandwidth check: 2-4 hours daily for dev work, longer Saturdays (4-8 hours), Sundays off. Gotta carve time for life stuff like fixing car rust (not filming that—repairs aren't my build jam; maybe a from-scratch car someday). We're iterating on ROI timelines as I update progress, aiming for realistic wins that build momentum without burnout.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="web-dev">
        <h2>Web Dev Adventures: Sprints, Marathons, and Affiliate Wins</h2>
        <p>I'm locked into web dev courses on codingforentrepreneurs.com, starting with Django.</p>
        <p>I have some bigger plans for this but wisdom prevails: Don't marathon first. Instead, kick off with simpler Django sites for sourcing guides on VORON 3D printers? CINEwhoop drones? —separate but under BuzzardBuilds. Income? Mainly affiliate commissions (Amazon, AliExpress links), but layer in ads, sponsorships, or premium content. Low-risk entry: Mostly sweat equity, with minor costs like hosting ($5-10/month), domains ($10-20/year), email tools, or plugins. No big cash outlay—perfect for bootstrapping and that sweet confidence boost from early dollars.</p>
        <p>How does it stack against the PCPartPicker clone? Guides are the sprint: Quicker build (1-2 months to launch), test affiliate waters, reuse code for the bigger tool. Excitement factor: High for both, tying into hobbies, but starting small avoids scope creep.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="skill-hustles">
        <h2>Leveraging Resume Superpowers: Packaging, CAD, and Content Creation</h2>
        <p>Drawing from my packaging engineering roots: Light woodworking skills could fuel a garage biz in custom case designs/builds (e.g., for electronics, drones). Hobby-level SolidWorks license allows up to $2K/year profit—currently at zero, so room to grow. I've mentored designers in SolidWorks before; why not market that? Target audience: Newbie packaging pros, hobbyists in CAD for drones/CNC. Imposter syndrome nags (I'm expert relative to packaging fields, not absolute), but past gigs prove value.</p>
        <p>YouTube/streaming angle: Structured videos on CAD work to showcase skills, build audience, and funnel to consulting. Past attempts fizzled from lack of structure and self-consciousness—solution? Themed series like "Buzzard Builds: CAD Crash Course." Small task to build momentum: Model a simple protective drone case in SolidWorks, narrate like chatting with a buddy. Finding mentees: YouTube's great for discovery, but also LinkedIn polls, Reddit (r/SolidWorks), or tapping resume contacts like friends or coworkers from EPE or Boeing.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="challenges">
        <h2>Challenges and Sass-Infused Strategies</h2>
        <p>Imposter syndrome on SolidWorks expertise? Flip it: Niche in packaging gives an edge—focus on pain points like cushion curves or reusable designs. Self-consciousness on camera? Start with fun avatars or anonymous vibes. Structure for content: Bite-sized sessions, track engagement metrics.</p>
        <p>Balancing acts: Dedicated blocks for learning, brainstorming, action. Distractions like car fixes? Prioritize "create-it" over "fix-it" to keep the fun alive. Overall: Assume good intent, iterate on plans, celebrate small wins like first affiliate clicks or view spikes.</p>
